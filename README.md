The TianmouC Camera is the latest vision chip featuring complementary pathways, developed by the Center for Brain-Inspired Computing Research (CBICR) at Tsinghua University in collaboration with Lynxi Technologies. Published in Nature on May 30, 2024, this innovative camera is inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) and mimics its dual-pathway information processing mechanism. It integrates a Cognition-Oriented Pathway (COP) for processing color, brightness, high resolution, and spatial details, alongside an Action-Oriented Pathway (AOP) that specializes in detecting temporal changes and motion dynamics, enabling rapid responses to dynamic environments. By handling spatial and temporal differences separately, the TianmouC Camera achieves superior adaptability in complex scenes. With a frame rate of up to 10,000 fps for AOP and 30 fps for COP, it is designed for high-speed vision applications that demand both precision and efficiency.
